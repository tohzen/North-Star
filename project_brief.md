## 1. The Problem (The "Current State")

Crabby Cakes Rescues (CCR) is a passionate, growing nonprofit animal shelter. Their current volunteer management process relies on a combination of a Google Forms, manual emails, and a single, complex Google Sheet. This "digital duct tape" system is no longer sustainable.

Key pain points include:
* **Incomplete Data:** Volunteer applications are often submitted with missing information (like phone numbers), requiring manual and time-consuming follow-up.
* **Manual Overload:** The director spends 10-15 hours per week manually sending follow-up emails, scheduling calls, and updating spreadsheets for volunteer shifts, adoptions, and donor information.
* **No Single Source of Truth:** Information is scattered, making it difficult to get a clear, real-time view of shelter operations, track volunteer hours for grants, or manage donor relationships effectively. This administrative burden is taking time away from the core mission of animal care and fundraising.

## 2. The Vision (The "Future State")

This project aims to build a centralized, automated system that dramatically reduces administrative overhead and provides a clear view of the entire operation. The three "magic wand" goals for a successful solution are:

1.  **Automate the Volunteer Journey:** Create an automated, seamless experience for new volunteers from their first application to their first shift, and completely eliminate the need for manual spreadsheet management.
2.  **Establish a Professional Web Presence:** Replace the current fragmented system with a single, professional-looking website for volunteer and donor engagement, without adding significant new costs.
3.  **Visualize Impact with Real-Time Data:** Create simple, "snapshot" views (reports and dashboards) that show key metrics like volunteer hours and animals helped, including a public-facing "adoption counter" to celebrate successes with the community.

## 3. Key Features & Requirements

To achieve this vision, the following features will be built on the Salesforce platform:

* A public-facing **Web Form** to capture new volunteer applications with required fields.
* An **Automated Email Welcome Series** for new applicants.
* A centralized system with **Custom Objects** to track `Volunteers`, `Shifts`, and `Animals`.
* A simple **Shift Scheduling** component.
* Automated tracking and reporting of **Volunteer Hours**.
* Real-time **Dashboards and Reports** to visualize key metrics.
* A public-facing **"Adoption Counter"** to showcase the shelter's impact.

## 4. Measures of Success

This project will be considered a success when it:
* Reduces administrative time spent on volunteer management by at least 10 hours per week.
* Provides clear, real-time data that can be used for grant applications and donor reports.
* Creates a more professional and engaging experience for new and existing volunteers.
